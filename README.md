# Project Name: Data Structure Static Libraries

## Overview

This project consists of static libraries for various data structures, including queue, stack, set, vector, and map. These libraries provide efficient and reusable implementations of essential data structures in C/C++ for use in your projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can use these static libraries, you'll need:

- A C/C++ development environment, such as GCC or Visual C++.
- A text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) for coding.

## Library Descriptions

### Queue

The queue library provides a simple, efficient, and thread-safe implementation of a queue data structure. It supports operations such as enqueue, dequeue, and checking the size of the queue.

### Stack

The stack library offers a basic stack data structure that supports push, pop, and peek operations. It's a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure that can be used for various applications.

### Set

The set library implements a set data structure with support for set operations like insertion, deletion, and membership checks. It ensures that each element in the set is unique.

### Vector

The vector library provides a dynamic array implementation. It allows for dynamic resizing, element insertion/removal, and random access to elements. It is suitable for scenarios where you need a resizable array.

### Map

The map library implements an associative container that maps keys to values. It provides efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. Keys are unique within the map.

## Usage

To use these libraries in your projects, follow these steps:

1. Include the header files corresponding to the data structures you want to use in your code.

   ```c
   #include "queue.h"
   #include "stack.h"
   #include "set.h"
   #include "vector.h"
   #include "map.h"
   ```

2. Link your project with the static library you built earlier (`libdatastructures.a`).

   ```bash
   gcc -o my_program my_program.c -L/path/to/Data-Structure-Libraries -ldatastructures
   ```

3. Start using the data structures in your code. Refer to the header files and documentation for specific usage instructions.
