In This Project, I have tried to Implement the Various Data Structures Like Stack, Queue, Set, etc. Which are present In Other Programming Languages Like C++, Java and Python In C, Which will reduce the efforts of
user making it easy for us to solve problems more easily In C Language.

# Implementation

For Implementing It I have Used :-
                  - Pointers.
                  - Structures In C
                  - Malloc 
                  - Realloc
                  - Generic Functions
                  - Memory Management
                  - Libraries
